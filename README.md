This guide will help you set up the T3RN Executor with the `setup-t3rn-executor.sh` script. Please follow the instructions carefully.

## GENERAL SETTINGS

1. **Set your preferred Node Environment.**  
   Example: export NODE_ENV
   ```bash
   testnet
   ```

## Executor Privacy

Read more about [Executor Privacy and Security](https://docs.t3rn.io/executor/become-an-executor/binary-setup) to ensure your setup is secure and private.

## NETWORKS & RPC

1. **Add your preferred networks to operate on.**  
   Example: export ENABLED_NETWORKS
   ```bash
   arbitrum-sepolia,base-sepolia,optimism-sepolia,l1rn
   ```
